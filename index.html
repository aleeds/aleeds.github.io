          <h1> Metric Space Deformation </h1>
          The following two canvas's represent a process that I am calling a "Metric Space Deformation". It is the projection of one metric space into another. 
          Now, what does all this mean?
          
          First, I shall define a metric space. I shall make it look mathematical and nice once I figure out how to do that. 
          
          A metric space is any Set S, with a function <it>d</it>: S X S -> R.
          The function <it>d</it> must have the following properties. 
          
          <p>&#8704 <it>x</it> &#8704 <it>y</it> <it>d(x,y) &#8805 0</it>
          <br>
          <it>d(x,y) = 0 &#8660 x = y</it>
          <br>
          And the triangle inequality holds
          
          A projection from one metric space to another is a deformation from S<sub>d</sub> to S<sub>d'</sub>, where <it>&#8704 x, d(x,&#966) = d'(x,&#966)</it>, where &#966 is the origin.
          The following is the projection of <it>d((x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>),(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)) = 
          |x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>| +  |y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>| </it> to the standard Euclidean Metric.
